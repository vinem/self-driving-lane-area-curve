# self-driving-lane-area-curve
Advanced Lane Finding Project as part of Udacity's Self Driving car engineer Nanodegree. This involves applying advanced computer vision techniques to identifying lanes even through shadows, calculating lane curvature and vehicle deviation from lane center,  correcting distortions in image due to camera, perspective transformations of images etc.
